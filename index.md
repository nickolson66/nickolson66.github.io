Nicholas is currently a student at The University at Albany studying Cybersecurity, where he holds a 3.6 GPA.

He held this GPA while working full time at Party City. He started as a temp through Spartech Inc., where he was able to surpass many more senior temps to be hired full time to a help desk role. 

There he went onto be promoted to a Specialist, Store Support position and Project Manager. 

Before joining the IT industry and attending college, Nicholas played Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege professionally for 5 years. In his free time, he loves spending time with his family and friends. He is an avid lover of movies and writes screenplays in his spare time, he was a quarterfinalist in the ScreenCraft Drama Competition for his screenplay <i> Luna <i>

# Project Manager

During his time at Party City, Nick was given the opportunity to lead a team of 8 employees to replace all of the pin pad terminals in all Party City Stores. 

These employees reported to him while working with techs to ensure these machines were replaced before the stores opened, making sure to not disrupt regular business operations.

Nicholas created progress reports, keeping track of what tasks were completed and which were outstanding.


## Specialist, Store Support

Nick led a small team in charge of the IT equipment in New Stores, Stores being relocated, closing stores and stores being remodeled

- New and Relocated stores equipment needs to be ordered, a process that was streamlined by Nick to become more efficient -- avoiding missing equipment and minimizing a tech's time on site and their billable hours. This led to tens of thousands of dollars saved during the process. Employee would work with tech to ensure equipment was installed and tested, making sure store can open and take customers.
- Stores would get remodeled overnight - receiving cosmetic updates to counters or other fixtures in stores. To do this, POS systems and store PC's needed to be taken offline. Nick worked with techs -- sometimes 8 at a time -- to make sure stores were ready to take customers once new fixtures were installed.
- Nick was also in charge of all of the telecom billing in the company. Each month, he would audit and pay monthly invoices from companies like Verizon, T-Mobile, 8x8 and Comcast to make sure invoices were paid correctly and on time. 

### Help Desk Technician

Contracted to Party City through Spartech Inc., Nick quickly seperated himself from other temps and received a full time job offer from Party City. 

Here he fielded calls from stores, quickly and efficiently solving problems at stores so they could continue taking customers. This included fixing point-of-sale machines, PCs, Microsoft Office bugs, Active Directory issues, Network connection problems and mobile devices.

He gained other responsibilities, like tracking of inventory that was sent from vendors to stores. Doing this ensured equipment would get back to stores, avoiding extra fees and saving the company more money.
