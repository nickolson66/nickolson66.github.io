Nicholas is currently a student at The University at Albany studying Cybersecurity, where he holds a 3.6 GPA.

He held this GPA while working full time at Party City. He started as a temp through Spartech Inc., where he was able to surpass many more senior temps to be hired full time to a help desk role. 

There he went onto be promoted to a Specialist, Store Support position and Project Manager. 

Before joining the IT industry and attending college, Nicholas played Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege professionally for 5 years.

# Project Manager

During his time at Party City, Nick was given the opportunity to lead a team of 8 employees to replace all of the pin pad terminals in all Party City Stores. 

These employees reported to him while working with techs to ensure these machines were replaced before the stores opened, making sure to not disrupt regular business operations.

Nicholas created progress reports, keeping track of what tasks were completed and which were outstanding.


## Specialist, Store Support

Nick led a small team in charge of the IT equipment in New Stores, Stores being relocated, closing stores and stores being remodeled

- New Stores equipment needs to be ordered, a process that was streamlined by Nick to become more efficient -- avoiding missing equipment and minimizing a tech's time on site and their billable hours. This led to tens of thousands of dollars saved during the process.
      - Employee would work with tech to ensure equipment was installed and tested, making sure store can open and take customers.
